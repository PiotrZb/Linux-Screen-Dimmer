# Linux-Screen-Dimmer üåô üñ•Ô∏è üíª
Linux Screen Dimmer is a simple script, created using `python` and `subprocess` library, which automates screen dimming.
The script uses the `xrandr` command-line tool, so you can decrease brightness even if your slidebar in power management settings is already set to the minimum level.

## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è
* `Python 3`
* `xrandr command-line tool`

## Usage üîÖ
You can use it via terminal...
```bash
python3 ScreenDimmer.py
```
```bash
python3 /path_to_script/ScreenDimmer.py
```
but I recommend creating a keyboard shortcut...

or creating launcher attached to the panel.

## Default values üõ†Ô∏è
```python3
BRIGHTNESS_VALUES = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.87, 1.0]
MONITOR_NAMES = get_monitor_names()
SAME_BRIGHTNESS_FOR_ALL_MONITORS = True
MIN_BRIGHTNESS_LVL = 0.3
MAX_BRIGHTNESS_LVL = 1.0
```

To set interesting you brightness values modify the `BRIGHTNESS_VALUES` array. 
Note that these values are limited by `MIN_BRIGHTNESS_LVL` and `MAX_BRIGHTNESS_LVL`.
If you want to always set the same brightness level for all monitors, keep `SAME_BRIGHTNESS_FOR_ALL_MONITORS` set to `True` otherwise change it to `False`.
The monitors whose brightness will be modified by the script are defined in `MONITOR_NAMES` and by default this array contains all the monitors aveliable via `xrandr --listmonitors`.
If you want to use this script only for selected monitors, you should list them in this array, example:

```python3
MONITOR_NAMES = ["eDP", "HDMI-0"]
```

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
* It's essential to have proper permissions to modify monitor settings using `xrandr`.
* Be careful when setting brightness levels, as extremely low brightness levels may result in a black screen or make the monitor barely visible.
* The script has only been tested on Linux Mint 21.2.
